Remote Repository:
  - A remote repository is a Git repository hosted on a remote server or a code hosting platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
  - It acts as a centralized location for collaborating changes from multiple developers, where multiple developers can push and pull     changes to keep the repository in sync.
  - We can not do any changes directly to remote repository and a valid user with proper access can push changes to remote repo from only local repo.

Local Repository:
  - A local repository is a copy of a Git repository that resides on your local machine.
  - It contains the complete copy of the repo repository, including all branches, commits, and files etc.
  - The local repository allows you to make changes, commit them, switch between branches, and perform Git operations without needing a live network connection to remote repo.
  - You can create a local repository by initializing a new repository with git init or cloning an existing repository using git clone.
  
  #To get a local repo / to download / clone a remote repo 
      git clone <url_of_the_remote_repository>

git status 
  - The git status is used to display the current status of your Git repository.
  - shows information about which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are untracked.

git log 
  - git log is used to view all commits history of a Git repository.
  - It displays list of commits starting from the most recent commit on top.
  - The commit history provides essential information about the changes made to the repository such as, 
      commit messages, authors, dates, and unique identifiers (commit hash/id).

git add 
  - Adds changes to the staging area. 
  - This is where you can review your changes before committing them to your local repository.
  # Add all changes to the staging area
    git add .   (OR)   git add --all
    
    git add -A is equivalent to git add --all
    git add -u is equivalent to git add --update
    
    NOTE: Extra information just in case if you want to try but not required
    Command	        New-Files	    Modified-Files	Deleted-Files	        Description
      git add -A	     YES	            YES	          YES	                Stage all (new, modified, deleted) files
      git add .	     YES	            YES	          YES	                Stage all (new, modified, deleted) files in current folder
      git add -u	      NO	            YES	          YES	                Stage modified and deleted files only
        
git commit 
  - Create a new commit containing the current changes of the stagging area (added files and directories)
  - We need to give a commit message which we can see in the git log message describing the changes.
  
  # Commit the changes with a message
      git commit -m "Added new feature"
      
git push 
  - git push is a command used to push your local commited changes (after git add and git commit) to a remote repository.
  - When you make changes to your local repository and want to share them with others or synchronize them with a remote repository 
    (such as on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), you use git push to send those changes to the remote repository.
  
git pull 
  - git pull is a command used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
  - When others pushed changes to the remote repository, you can use git pull to update your local repository to get new commits from remopte repository.

git merge vs rebase 

Both git merge and rebase are used to combines the changes from one branch into another branch but different approaches to integrating changes from one branch into another in Git

merge 
   - Merge creates a new commit which shows the changes combined from both branches. 
   - Merge preserves the history of both branches, so you can see which changes came from which branch.
   - Merge can sometimes create merge conflicts, we need to discuss with the developers and solve the merge conflicts to complete the merge.
     (usually merge conflicts occurs if 2 different users try the chagne the same lines in the same file and if we try to merge it)
   
rebase 
   - Rebase do not creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. 
   - Rebase rewrites the history of the first branch, it will bring all the commits from source branch and place it to the tip of 
     the destination branch. (Commit history usually will become a linear and cleaner tree)
   - Rebases do not create merge conflicts, but they can make it difficult to track the history of your repository.  
   
git fetch vs pull

git fetch and git pull are both used to update local repository changes from remote repository.

git fetch 
  - Brings the changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
  - Does not automatically merge the changes into your current branch in local repository.
  - Instead it keeps changes in a temporary branch called FETCH_HEAD and we can inspect the changes then decide how you want to integrate       them into our local work in local repository.

git pull
  - git pull, combines the functionality of git fetch and git merge in a single step.
  - It fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into the current local branch. 
  - It updates the remote-tracking branches with local branch and incorporates the changes into your local branch.
  - It performs an automatic merge, which means if there are conflicts, we will need to resolve them.
   
git cherry-pick
  - git cherry-pick is a Git command used to pick and apply a specific commit from one branch to another. 
  - It allows us to select individual commits and apply them to a different branch, essentially picking out specific changes/commits.  
  
  STEP1: Choose and remember the commit to put it in another branch (source branch)
          git log
  STEP2: Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commit (destination branch)
          git checkout <destination_branch>
  STEP3: git cherry-pick with the commit which we want to apply (from STEP1)
          git cherry-pick <source_branch_commit>
  
git stash 
  - The git stash command is used to save the current state of your working directory and index, which is a temporary area where you can        store changes that you're not ready to commit yet. 
  - This is useful for when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task, but you don't want to lose the changes        you've made so far and dont want to commit it yet.
  
  # To stash the current un-commited changes 
        git stash 
  # To list all the stashes 
        git stash list 
  # To bring the stash back 
        git stash pop 
            - To apply the recent stash and also remove the most recent stash in a single operation.
        git stash apply
            - This subcommand applies the most recent stash back to your working directory, restoring the changes you stashed.           
  # To remove changes from stash 
        git stash drop

Branch 
branch is a parallel version of another branch repository. 
It allows multiple users to work on different versions of files & directories simultaneously, isolating the changes you make from one branch to another branch.
we always create a branch from another branch.

To list all the branches in the local repository: git branch
To create a new branch named "development": git branch development 
To change the current branch: git checkout <new_branch>
To delete a branch named "development": git branch -d development
To create a branch and checkout simultaneously: git checkout -b <new_branch>
Origin (Not required for Interview)

Origin in Git: In Git, "origin" refers to the default alias name for the remote repository (URL) from which a local repository was cloned.
Cloning Repositories: When you clone a repository using Git, the cloned repository is linked to the original repository from which it was copied, and this connection is labelled as "origin".
Push and Pull: Git uses "origin" as the default alias when pushing changes from a local repository to the remote repository, as well as when pulling changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
Multiple Remotes: While "origin" is the default remote name, Git allows users to add multiple remote repositories with custom names to enable collaboration with various remote repositories. (Usually, we never add multiple remotes)
Checkout 
used to switch between different branches, and commits.

Switch to commit: we can switch to any commit using git checkout 
             git checkout <commit_it>
Switching Branches: It allows you to move to a different branch within a repository.
             git checkput <branch>
Merge 

Merge creates a new commit which shows the changes combined from both branches. 
Merge preserves the history of both branches, so you can see which changes came from which branch.
Merge can sometimes create merge conflicts, we need to discuss with the developers and solve the merge conflicts to complete the merge.
    (usually merge conflicts occur if 2 different users try the change the same lines in the same file and if we try to merge it)

Revert vs Reset

git reset
History Rewriting: git reset is used to erase commits from the project's history, effectively rewriting the commit history.
Local Changes: It is commonly used to undo local changes, discarding uncommitted modifications and resetting the staging area and working directory.
Caution Required: It is a powerful and potentially dangerous command that can permanently delete commits, so it should be used with caution, especially when working with shared repositories.

git revert
Undo Commit: git revert is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a specific previous commit.
Preservation of History: Unlike git reset, it does not rewrite history. Instead, it creates a new commit that effectively undoes the changes from the specified commit while preserving the project's commit history.
Safe Undoing: It is a safer option for reverting changes, especially when working in a shared repository, as it does not alter the existing commit history.
  
git cherry-pick
 - git cherry-pick is a Git command used to pick and apply a specific commit from one branch to another. 
 - It allows us to select individual commits and apply them to a different branch, essentially picking out specific changes/commits.

         git cherry-pick <source_branch_commit>


Centralised Version Control System (CVCS):

Uses a central server to store the entire codebase and version history.
Relies heavily on network connectivity for most operations.
Collaboration involves checking out and checking in files from the central server.
Offers centralised control for enforcing access controls and security measures.
Branching and merging can be more complex compared to DVCS.
Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):

Each user has a complete local repository with the full project history.
Allows users to work offline and synchronise changes later.
Facilitates flexible and independent collaboration among developers.
Provides better redundancy and backup capabilities with each user's local copy.
Excels in branching and merging, making it easier to experiment with new features.
git stash 

The git stash command is used to save the current state of your working directory and index, which is a temporary area where you can store changes that you're not ready to commit yet. 
This is useful for when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task, but you don't want to lose the changes you've made so far and don't want to commit it yet.
 
 # To stash the current un-committed changes 
       git stash 
 # To list all the stashes 
       git stash list 
 # To bring the stash back 
       git stash pop 
           - To apply the recent stash and also remove the most recent stash in a single operation.
       git stash apply
           - This subcommand applies the most recent stash back to your working directory, restoring the changes you stashed.           
 # To remove changes from stash 
       git stash drop 
git tag 
 

A tag is a pointer to a specific commit. 
A human-readable name to commit id.
commits are difficult to remember as they contain 40 digit random strings, so we create a tag for the commit to share. 
multiple tags can be created for the same commit_id but one tag can point to only one commit.
Creating a Lightweight Tag:
To tag the latest commit: git tag <tag_name>
To tag a commit: git tag <tag_name> <commit>

Creating an Annotated Tag:
An annotated tag includes extra metadata such as tagger name, email, date, and a tagging message. 
git tag -a <tag_name> -m "Your annotation message"

To delete a tag: git tag -d <tag_name>

Pushing Tags to a Remote Repository: git push --tags
